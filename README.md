## About

I'm a self-taught developer currently working on dynamic web applications. Proficient in developing servers, databases, creating user interfaces, writing and testing codes. Passionate around solving problems through innovation and engineering practices.

Some of the tecnologies I work with are ReactJS on the client and NodeJS on the server side. Constant development of new tecnologies, however, drive me to keep learning and implementing new features. Looking fordward working with a team to create great things.
