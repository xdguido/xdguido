## About

#### I'm a self-taught developer currently working on full-stack dynamic web applications. Proficient in developing databases, creating user interfaces, writing and testing codes.

#### I primarily write in JavaScript. Some of the tecnologies I work with are React JS on the frontend and Express JS and MongoDB on the backend. Constant develop of frameworks, however, drive me to keep learning and implementing new features.
